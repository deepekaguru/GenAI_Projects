# ðŸ’Š DrugInfoGen â€“ Know Your Medicine

DrugInfoGen is a user-friendly web application designed to help people quickly understand medications. Whether you're curious about a medication you've been prescribed or seeking treatment options for a common condition, this tool provides easy access to reliable, readable information.

The app allows you to search in two simple ways:  
1. **By drug name** â€“ You can enter the name of a medication, such as "ibuprofen" or "metformin", and get details about what it's used for, potential side effects, and any important precautions.  
2. **By medical condition** â€“ You can choose from a list of common health issues, like fever or indigestion, and see a list of medications that are typically used to treat that condition.

Each result includes organized sections that explain how the drug works, what to watch out for, and helpful summary points. The design is clean and minimal, so users can focus on the information without distractions. Useful links to trusted websites such as Drugs.com and WebMD are also provided for reference.

DrugInfoGen was built with the idea of making health information more accessible. It doesnâ€™t replace medical advice, but it gives users a starting point to better understand the medications they encounter in everyday life.
